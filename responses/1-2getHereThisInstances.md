# Q2 Blank Screen

When I run my code all I get is a blank screen. There must me something wrong with React I swear I'm rendering the component correctly.

```jsx
import React from 'react' 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' 
 
function App() { 
  return ( 
    <h1>Big h1 tag</h1> 
  ) 
} 
 
ReactDOM.render( 
  App, 
  document.getElementById('root') 
) 
```
